    "Hey there! I'm Aditya Rathore, a software engineer who loves working with Flutter and exploring the world of machine learning. I've had the chance to contribute to cool projects like Hugging Face Transformers, where I helped expand its features with LlamaForQuestionAnswering.\nWhen I'm not geeking out over code, I dive into the Flutter community, sharing ideas and helping to improve the framework. My toolkit is pretty diverseâ€”think Python, JavaScript, Flutter, AWS, React, Node.js, and more.",
